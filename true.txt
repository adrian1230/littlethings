Randomness or Probability is the result of the limited elements that we can access to.

Statistics is subjective. Even using all the data of the entire population, 
data cleaning and assumptions can turn the conclusions less objective.

Correlation is drawn, whenever a positive or negative tendency is created. 
Correlation does not imply causation. 

Faith and understanding can be two opposite locations. You did not analyse
and create theories in science and humanities; but, you chose to believe in
Some of them and not the others. Only a fraction comprehended with your 
experience.

You cannot use fire to put out fire.

Collective memories have to be collective, objectively, otherwise. It will
not be collective.

An artistic image does not have to reflect historical image.

History can be written without long practice but not literature; as to be 
good quality.

Abundance does not reflect profoundness.

Math models and predictions match, precisely or approximatively,
to the experiments does not imply the existence of the predicted 
objects. human minds / brains are capable of creating 
misinterpreted or wrong conclusions.

Established terms or facts can be coined based on over-populated opinions
but may not be of actuality and reality. 

Though our senses trick us, but we never say it 50% exists. We only proclaim
that it exists or it does not exist; 100% vs 0%. If one thing or person lost
half of herself, then it still exists 100%. If there is something beyond
our senses but it exists, then it does. If we can only think based on these
senses and numerous other biased metrics.

If one does not exist, there is no way you can manipulate those that do not exist. 
If unicorn does not exist, then a vacuum machine cannot make contact with it. 

The mythology is an interesting way to understand a culture. 
Regardless of its absurdity or novelty, if we cannot judge with all detail, 
then we only say this can be a probability greater than 0%.

You should keep suspecting facts and think critically yourself. Do not reject
and accept all things as they are told; but, accept those as a possibility until
you can judge and conclude, eternally or temporarily, from all, accessed, 
perspectives.

Data is neither positive nor negative.

Psychological time is a necessity to create logic in order to make 
sense of the world but does not exist.? You feel psychological slower 
when you do sprinting, does not mean time slows down same for time dilation 

Correlation mean if positive or negative pattern or tendency is shown,
causation can be the demand of logic as we need to perform understanding,
critical analysis, or prediction.

The Cognitive Logic of humans, if not all higher intelligence, influences how
we think and comprehend things in arts and nature.

If the time we discussed in physics is universally objective, then, besides correlation, why
Time can cause the variance and flow of growth rate.

Predictions, in large scale, will only be highly approximative, otherwise. 
There is no game to play. 

As a human, explanation is required by us and gained through Arts and Science,
but, even Arts is human-centric, does not mean the ultimate questions in life
can only or mostly be answered by science. In the edge of edges, humanities
is the only mean, for now and possibly the only, to meet our need for 
explanation not quantified, explained, visualised by science. Such as the 
motive of life assuming that there isn't none.

Mathematical Physics corrupts Experimental Physics, for now. As physics nowadays only requires
itself to fit the data regardless of how ridiculous or unrealistic concepts they have as 
objects. Black holes may not exist as no direct effect or observation was made, but if it is
the most suitable candidate for describing the theory with prediction, then there you go, we got
black holes. Experiments helps, not always.

If you have history of something, then you can have it for zero if it is gone; otherwise, there
will be no zero for that thing.

History without full details can never be complete; maybe you can infer from other sources, 
but it terrifies us as it never be complete or accurate as ancient as it goes.

Other scholars or editors may add their views to books without making 
the source as from them. It does not mean the added views are wrong. 

Skepticism requires evidence and critical reasoning, otherwise. 
it means nothing for you, even it is right.

Less development, less consumption, less energy problems.

Advanced civilisation meets and helps less-developed native, a god and a religion can be created.
